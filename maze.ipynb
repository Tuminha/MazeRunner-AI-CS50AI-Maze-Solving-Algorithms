    "# Depth-First Search (DFS) vs. Breadth-First Search (BFS) in Maze Solving\n",
    "\n",
    "In this hands-on exercise from the CS50AI Harvard University course, we've explored the differences between Depth-First Search (DFS) and Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithms in the context of solving a maze.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Observations:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **BFS Effectiveness**: We observed that Breadth-First Search successfully found a path from point A to point B in our maze.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **State Exploration**: However, BFS needed to explore a large number of states to find the solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **DFS vs. BFS Trade-offs**:\n",
    "   - **Memory Usage**: In some cases, DFS may offer memory savings compared to BFS.\n",
    "   - **State Exploration**: BFS often explores more states than necessary, which can be computationally expensive.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Situational Performance**: It's important to note that the efficiency of these algorithms can vary depending on the specific problem and maze structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Next Steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we understand the theoretical differences between DFS and BFS, we'll dive into the practical implementation of these algorithms. We'll examine and write code to implement both Depth-First Search and Breadth-First Search for maze solving.\n",
    "\n",
    "This coding exercise will help us better understand how these algorithms work in practice and allow us to compare their performance in different scenarios."

    "Now that we've seen how Depth-First Search (DFS) performs on our maze, let's shake things up a bit! 🎭 We're going to tackle the same maze, but this time with a different approach: Breadth-First Search (BFS).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why BFS? 🤔\n",
    "\n",
    "DFS gave us a solution, sure, but it might have taken the scenic route to get there. 🏞️ It explored more states than necessary, which isn't always ideal. So, we're curious: can BFS do better?\n",
    "\n",
    "## The BFS Advantage 🚀\n",
    "\n",
    "BFS has a neat trick up its sleeve:\n",
    "- It explores all neighbors at the current depth before moving to the next level.\n",
    "- This strategy often leads to finding the shortest path to the goal. 🏆\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Magic of Queue 🎩✨\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's the exciting part: switching from DFS to BFS is surprisingly simple! The core algorithm remains the same, but we make one crucial change:\n",
    "\n",
    "- DFS uses a stack (Last In, First Out)\n",
    "- BFS uses a queue (First In, First Out)\n",

      "   - For maze1.txt:\n",
      "     * Steps: BFS needed 10 steps and DFS needed 10 steps. Both have the same efficiency in terms of path length.\n",
      "     * States: Both algorithms explored the same number of states (11). This indicates that the maze structure didn't particularly favor either search strategy in terms of memory efficiency.\n",
      "   - For maze2.txt:\n",
      "     * Steps: BFS needed 30 steps and DFS needed 30 steps. Both have the same efficiency in terms of path length.\n",
      "     * States: BFS explored fewer states (59 vs 74). This means BFS was more memory-efficient, exploring a smaller portion of the maze before finding the solution. It indicates that BFS's breadth-first approach was more suitable for this maze structure, avoiding unnecessary exploration of dead ends.\n"
